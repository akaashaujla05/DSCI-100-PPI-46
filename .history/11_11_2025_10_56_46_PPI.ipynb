    "### 4.) Method and Plan \n",
    "\n",
    " Specific Quetion : Can hours played predict a player’s experience level in the players.csv dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address my question of interest, I will use the players dataset focusing on the quantitative variable played_hours to classify which experience level a player belongs to. Since experience can take one of five possible categories (Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Veteran, and Pro), this is a multiclass classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive method chosen is K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This method is appropriate because it classifies an observation with an unknown label based on how similar it is to other observations with known labels. In our case, KNN will predict a player’s experience level based on how closely their play time resembles that of other players.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, we assume that players with similar total hours of Minecraft play will also have similar experience levels. In other words, players who have played roughly the same amount of time are likely to fall within the same experience category. An example of how this assumption works would be that all new/amateur players may require more hours to become familiar with the game compared to Veteran players who already have experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that the data is properly processed such as scaling it so that the distance calculations used in the KNN algorithm are valid. Since KNN relies on measuring distance between observations to make predictions through a voting system, it is important that all numeric variables have mean of zero and standard deviation of one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since our dataset includes many outliers (some players have extreme numbers of playtime, while others have none), this poses a limitation to our method of classification. Our KNN model will now have altered decision boundaries, which can cause misclassifications of classes. A single outlier added to the dataset can shift the classification boundary, causing an error in the classification for a large region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Processing Steps Needed:\n",
    "Tidy Data = Have no NA values within the data set.\n",
    "Ensure that the data is scaled with a mean of zero and SD of zero \n",
    "Use the as_factor() function in R to convert the experiences variables into a classifier, allowing KNN to treat it as a categorical response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the most effient KNN model I will load in the tidymodels package and test a range of k values=tune k (eg. 1–10) and compare their accuracy using a 5 fold cross validation system. The k that gives the highest cross validated accuracy will be chosen as the optimal model.  We will split our original data set into training and test sets, then we will create our K nearest neighbors classifier with only the training set. We will use 75% of the data for training and 25% for testing.\n"
