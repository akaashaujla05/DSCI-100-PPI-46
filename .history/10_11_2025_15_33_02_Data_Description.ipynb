Several entries have missing (NA) values in the age variable, which limits the ability to assess how player age relates to play time. Additionally, some players have unusually large recorded hours of play time, which are likely data entry or logging errors. These extreme outliers could distort averages and weaken the validity of statistical results. To address these issues, missing values may need to be imputed or removed, and unrealistic play-time values filtered out before further analysis. \n"
